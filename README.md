# Advent of Code 2023

Hello, and welcome to my solutions to Advent of Code 2023! Like last year, I'll
be writing these in Rust to continue to learn the language better, and ideally
I'll write up what I learned and my thought process behind my solution each day.
It worked great last year, and I learned a _ton_ about Rust.
